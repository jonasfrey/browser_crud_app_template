# APN
This project is coded entirely with APN Abstract Prefix Notation. To get a better understanding you can read the paper https://zenodo.org/records/18743663

## Remember
This project exposes many functionalities of the 'server' which is essentaly the computer . The webapplication GUI 'only' serves as a front end for the application. However this can be extended in a way to make it a sturdy and secure webapplication. The fundamentals however are here to give full access to the computer. This is not unsecure, it is just a solid base. 
Remember: 
Just because a system is unclear and obfuscated, it does not mean it is secure. security through obscurity is not good. 


Have Fun !
